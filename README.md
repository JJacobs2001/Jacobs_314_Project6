Repository for sample data from Project 6 regarding feminism

This repository hosts the responses that I have gathered from surveying people about feminism. The interviewees were asked
questions about the level of their feelings towards different approaches to feminism and their impact on society.
Data on the respondents' ages and occupations were collected, alongside an optional gender input option.
